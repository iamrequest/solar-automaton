# About

This was my submission to "Godot XR Game Jam 3 (February 2025)", a 7 day game jam. The goal for this one was to try out Godot as a game development engine - the feature set is intentionally pretty sparse, since the focus was to get familiar with the engine.

You can download the game for free [here, on itch.io](https://request.itch.io/solar-automaton),
or you can check out my other projects at [request.moe](https://request.moe). You can also find [the postmortem for this project, here](/postmortem.md)!


This project was made with:
* Godot 4.3
* Godot XR Toggle
* Ovani BGM plugin

This project includes some paid assets that are *not* included in this repository - the project will likely have some errors if you try to import them.
